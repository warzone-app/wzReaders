              I am a recent bootcamp graduate from Fullstack Academy. WZReaders
              is the most recent project I worked on. I see myself as a
              problem-solver, and Iâ€™m always looking for a new challenge. I love
              building web applications with new technologies, frameworks, and
              strive to be a web developer well versed in team collaboration. I
              want to be able to formulate and conceptualize a professional web
              presence within the tech industry.

              I'm a full-stack software developer. I have previously studied
              Statistics but after immersing myself in an intensive training at
              Fullstack Academy for software development, I found that I really
              enjoyed it and grew a passion for it. Through this process I
              realized I enjoyed the challenges in problem solving and going
              through it with a team. I am eager to learning new technologies,
              ready to use the tools and experiences that Ive learned, and
              looking to apply my skills toward meaningful causes.
